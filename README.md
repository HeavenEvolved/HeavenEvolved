## About Me

I am a Machine Learning Engineer and analytics professional currently pursuing a dual Master's—an MBA in Business Analytics and an MS in Decision Analytics (Data Science) at Virginia Commonwealth University.

My work bridges machine learning with business decision-making. I specialize in developing intelligent systems that integrate NLP, computer vision, and deep learning to support high-impact, data-driven solutions. I focus particularly on RAG-based knowledge assistants, workflow automation, and the deployment of scalable AI applications.

## Selected Projects

**Multimodal Knowledge Assistant**
Developed an assistant for querying documents (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX) using LangChain and LlamaIndex.

**Transformer-Based CV Screening Tool**
Built a pipeline using T5, BART, and Mistral for automated CV filtering with human-in-the-loop evaluation.

**Infrared Intoxication Detection**
Created a CNN model for analyzing real-time infrared sensor streams, achieving 87% accuracy at 15 FPS.

**Profanity Detection in Video Conferencing**
Implemented a hybrid LSTM + BERT model achieving 92% precision for real-time speech moderation.

**Lip-Sync Generator with Voice Cloning**
Integrated speech-to-text and text-to-speech components to build a video generator with lip-synced avatars.
