# About Me

Hi! I am @HeavenEvolved. You can call me either Indie or Evo depending on whatever you prefer. I am a March 2022 Computer Science graduate and I am currently working as a ‚ú® Software Development Engineer - Machine Learning ‚ú®. I love to watch Movies, play Video Games, go Swimming, read Manga/Manhwa/Wuxia and watch Anime in my free time. I also spend a lot of free time hanging around in the [Python Discord](https://pythondiscord.com/ "Python Discord Website") server helping random strangers with questions related to Python and asking a few questions myself üòÖ I sometimes also spend my time on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/m_ujjwalakshith?hr_r=1 "My HackerRank Profile") where I am a 5 ‚≠ê Python Developer, just trying to keep my Python skills well-polished. I don't consider myself a Python expert, but I manage to get by with the help of Google and the [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/ "Python Docs").

# What Am I Up To Now? üòâ

I am currently learning PyTorch and Transformers and working on refining my skills in TensorFlow/Keras, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision.
